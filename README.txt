 @ Description

 Comparing gene sequences using sequence based tools is complex and
 the current method of manual comparsion is clearly inefficient. Researchers 
 spend weeks to compare recently generated sequences to the sequences that
 already exist in their database. Here, we implement computationally 
 feasible approaches to relate/ compare biosynthetic models at the levels
 of domains, genes, modules and pathways allowing approximate matches at
 each stage. 

 This repository contains Java code for comparing biosynthetic pathways,
 retrieving near-similar pathways.
